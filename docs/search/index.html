Data: subscribed services relevant data’s is refreshed, but geolocation is not.  Plane Mode: neither data nor geolocation are refreshed. This setting will impact your ability to retrieve data in our APIs. Effect on WebPortal: As an embedded application developer (Webportal v1 &amp; v2), only API that match the current privacy are available. That’s why your application needs to handle the privacy settings selected by the user. See privacy webportal v1 or privacy Webportal v2 for more info. You can retrieve required level of privacy of each API in the references: Webportal v1 or Webportal v2. Effect on Web API: If you are a fleet owner (WEB API B2B) you can access your vehicle data. However, in order to be compliant with GDPR, you should use the query parameter profile as described here. If you are developing end-user applications (Web API B2C v4), you can only access data that match the current privacy mode of the vehicle.  Reminder: Whatever the privacy selected in the vehicle, you can only access the data allowed in the data scope of the Connected Vehicle Services your vehicle subscribed.

Use Case Example: Let’s imagine a car rental company owning electric cars. It is possible for each local agency to map the charging station in the area, it would be useful in order to inform the customers… But using our monitoring feature, you can receive an event in your Information System when a customer is leaving the area where the charging stations are. Then you will be able to send a notification (OS notification, SMS, email…) to your customer to remind him or her to be careful. If you want to be more precise, it is also possible to create a more complex monitor triggered when the vehicle is leaving the area after 10pm, and only if the vehicle battery is under 30%.

  "body": " Stellantis Connected Car API Connected Car API IntroductionThis is the description of the Stellantis Connected Car V2 API. The speccification is is based on OpenAPI Specification version 3 and can be displayed using ReDoca or Swagger. This API allows applications to fetch data from the Connected Vehicles Data Platform. It is designed to be a declarative data and function specification, so they are understood and consumed by stakeholders without knowledge of manufacturer onboard vehicle specification API Features::  VEHICLE IOT DATA TREATMENT DEVICE MANAGEMENT Subscription, Commercial Capabilites, Management:     SAMS: Subscription management, it includes frontend/backend/Catalog(Zuora). As well as API exposition for Eligibility, Catalog, Cart, Payment, Contract. In PRODUCTION   CPA: Technical enabler responsible for onboarding and processing the reconciliation between a token and an ID Digital (Customer ID in C1ST).  In DEVELOPMENT   OMS: Technical enabler responsible for managing the link between the vehicle pre-command until delivery to the client.  In DEVELOPMENT   PROMAN:  Technical enabler responsible for managing the workflow of services activation.  In DEVELOPMENT    ABCAPI Authentication: Stellantis Connected Car APIs uses the OAuth 2. 0 protocol for authentication and authorization. Any application require a valid Access Token to access to data.  Hierarchical Scopes     Since api resources are hierarchical, API uses also hierarchical scopes. Colon characters are used to navigate to subresource scopes.     Filtering Scopes         When the API caller requests a set of scopes. The owner may not grant access to all of the requested scopes, so the application will have to adapt to the restricted access or request for a larger set of scopes again.           API backend will deliver the data related to the granted scopes only.           If no scope has been granted with the caller token then an unauthorized error will be returned.       API Errors: Error codes returned by all APIs comply with the standard. Nevertheless, PSA Services (callers) need to have more detailed data structures (even when the answer is not Http-OK) to better categorize the type of error by providing application code, message and debugging code(for investigation purposes). The HTTP code of the response is managed by the protocol itself (in the header). These APIS are likely to report the following HTTP code: Tables:       Code. .    Description…   Case. .            200   The request has succeeded and the resource data has been sent.    GET APIs.            202   The request has been accepted for processing, but not yet acted upon. An id of processing is returned.    POST/PUT requests: -Create monitor -Create a callback           204   The request has been accepted and there is no additional content   DELTE APIs: -Delete monitor -Delete a callback           400   Request cannot be processed due to invalid query parameter value of body content (for POST/PUT verbs)   ALL APIs.            401   Unauthorized request due to lack of valid authentication credentials.    All APIs.            403   Unauthorized request due to insufficient credentials to grant access.    All APIs.            404   Target resource not found.    All APIs. Even POST, PUT or DELETE if the resource id is uncknown.            500   Unexpected condition that prevented from fulfilling the reques.    All APIs.        API Output: Data format All APIs return data in JSON format. The application who uses them must take into account the evolving character of them and more precisely regarding the schemas of the exposed data. Indeed:  The missing of known data fields should not cause an error.  It should (correctly) deal with JSON content with unknown properties also. Indeed, data schema extensions should be supported without errors even if they are not used. For example:Assuming a given exposed resource with this data schema: 123456789 { data:    type: object    description: Data model    properties:      field1:        type: string      field2:        type: number }The application should be able to deal with those possible valid JSON contents:  All fields:  field1 : value1 ,  field2 : 1 Missing field2:  field1 : value1  Unknown field3:  field1 : value1 ,  field3 : 2. 5 "

  "title": "Authentication",
  "body": "Authentication B2BIn this tutorial you will find an explanation about getting your B2B authentication in Stellantis network. This authentication is required in order to consume Stellantis API. This page is dedicated to Stellantis’s commercial partners. End-user authentication procedure is different, check this page. Our API let you access sensible data about your fleet of vehicles, that’s why we have to perform mutual authentication between our networks. In order to sign your certificate we need you to produce a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). At the end of this process you will have everything you need to consume our B2B API for connected vehicles! Login info:  MZP: partner login in Stellantis network.  Password: partner password in Stellantis network.  Client ID: Client credentials to generate OAuth.  Client Certificate: trusted SSL certificate signed by the dedicated Stellantis authority.  Private Key: Your Private Key file. 1. Partner Login: First step is to get a Stellantis login (ex: MZP123456). Information required to get this is already available with Stellantis as all the call centers are already integrated with legacy platforms. Stellantis team will create accounts and share it. 2. Encryption Keys &amp; CSR: Once you have received MZP login, next step is to produce SSL keys and CSR. These keys will allow encrypted communication between you and Stellantis:  Public key will be used by Stellantis to encrypt messages.  Private key will be used by you to decrypt Stellantis’s messages. Be careful, your private key is secret you need to keep it safe on your network. In order to ensure your identity we have to perform signing process of your public key and general info about your company. That is why you need to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). We will sign your CSR and send you back a proper SSL certificate. Here is info we need in your CSR:       Information   Value         COUNTRY NAME (C)   Country code, two letters (ex: FR)       STATE OR PROVINCE (S)   ex: ‘Kansas’ or ‘Ile de France’       LOCALITY NAME (L)   ex: ‘Paris’       ORGANIZATION NAME (O)   ex: ‘Free2Move’       ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT (OU)   You must type: ‘Programs Partners’       COMMON NAME (CN)   ex: ‘MZP128745’       EMAIL ADDRESS   Email address, will be used in order to download and renew your certificate   Producing encryption keys and CSR have to be done with a dedicated software. Here is examples with two of them: 2. 1 With OpenSSL: OpenSSL is an open-source software library for encryption purpose. It is widely used in internet security. You can download and install Open SSL using this link (Windows). With OpenSLL producing key and creating CSR can be performed in one step. Create a directory with text configuration file named like ‘CSRConfig. conf’ and copy/past this text into it: 12345678910111213[ req ]default_bits = 2048distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name[ req_distinguished_name ]countryName = COUNTRY NAME (C) two letters ex: FRstateOrProvinceName = STATE OR PROVINCE (S) ex: Kansas or Ile de FrancelocalityName = LOCALITY NAME (L) ex: ParisorganizationName = ORGANIZATION NAME (O) ex: Free2MoveorganizationalUnitName = ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT (OU) Press enter or Programs PartnersorganizationalUnitName_default = Programs PartnerscommonName = COMMON NAME (CN) ex: MZP128745emailAddress = EMAIL ADDRESS will be used in order to download and renew your certificateBrowse this place with your terminal and execute this command: 12345$ openssl req \ -new \ -keyout KeyName. pem \ -out CSRName. csr \ -config CSRConfig. conf KeyName. pem will be your keyfile name CSRName. csr will be your CSR name CSRConfig. conf is configuration file’s nameYou will be requested for info incorporated in your CSR. Once you fill it you will get your CSR and Keyfile in your directory. 2. 2 With Keytool: Keytool comes with Java Devlopment Kit. Like OpenSSL, it can be used to produce keys (in a file name keystore) and CSR. Produce your keys using this command: 1234567$ keytool \ -genkey \ -alias KeyName \ -keyalg RSA \ -keysize 2048 \ -dname  CN=MZPXXXX,OU=Programs Partner,O=PatrnerName,L=&lt;Paris,C=FR,email=it@partner. com  \ -keystore KeyStoreName. jks CN Common Name (ex MZP128745) OU Do not replace Programs Partners is right O Organization Name (ex Free2Move) L Locality Name (ex Paris) C Country Name two letters (ex: FR) email will be used in order to download and renew your certificate Keyname will be the name of the keys in the keystore KeyStoreName. jks will be the name of your keystoreGenerate your CSR: 12345$ keytool \ -certreq \ -alias Keyname \ -keystore KeyStoreName. jks \ -file CSRName. csr Keyname is the name of the keys in the keystore KeyStoreName. jks is the name of your keystore CSRName. csr will be the name of the CSR3. Submit CSR: Once you have created your brand-new CSR file, send it to your contact in Stellantis. At this point we will begin our internal process to sign your certificate. 4. Certificate &amp; Client ID: If everything is ok, our certification authority will accept your Certificate Signing Request. Then you’ll receive an email at the adress you specified. This email contains: link to download your certificate &amp; Stellantis CA certificate + Client ID (= application id). Download your signed certificate and keep carefully your client ID. 5. Request for OAuth2 credentialsOnce you have certificate downloaded, please send it across to your Stellantis contact. Stellantiswill begin process to generate Client Credentials that can be used to generate OAuth2 token. Certificate will be configured on Stellantis IDP side as OAuth2 token generation will be mTLS (ClientId+ Client Certificate). Once the credentials are generated, you will receive email with details togenerate OAuth2 token (IDP URL/Client Id &amp; scope). 6. Request SampleTo be able to use Stellantis API, you need to be authenticated as partner in Stellantis network. 6. 1 Generate OAuth2 token : Using the client credentials received in Step 5, generate OAuth2 token. 12345https : //idfed-preprod. mpsa. com/as/token. oauth2 POST: client_id=[received in step 5] grant_type=client_credentials scope=[received in step 5]6. 2 Invoke the required API sending OAuth2 token as Bearer token along with Client Id receivedin Step 4. Please refer to Swagger file for request samples. See AlsoTutorialA Quick Start guide is provided to help you understand the basics and get started.

  "title": "App Registration",
  "body": "Requirement:  Before starting this tutorial, we strongly encourage you to read authentication in Web API.  📱 A brief description of your App (concept, requested vehicle data, requests per month, app name, company name, contact email). Tutorial Output:  👤 A registered Application and its credentials (Client ID/secret, Certificates, MZP).  🔑 Your Application private key. This tutorial explains how to register your application in Stellantis systems. At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the credentials required to enroll a user in your App. Registration Process: The following schema explains the process to register your Application in order to obtain a Client ID and a Client Secret.  1️⃣ Describe your Application: As the Accessing Party (or Third-Party Application), you are building an Application requesting access to End-User vehicle’s data. Mobilisights is Stellantis company for connected mobility. They are the one able to register an Application. In order to register the App in Stellantis system, you should contact Mobilisights with the following App description:  📱 Then Name &amp; Concept of your Application compliant to ExVe, GDPR &amp; Stellantis Rules.  👩🏽‍💻 The Name &amp; Email of you or your company.  📊 An estimation of the number of Requests per month.  🚙 The list of vehicle data required for your App.         Request Your App Registration          If your application project is approved, Mobilisight will create a Login Identifier (or MZP) and request a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) to proceed your App registration. 2️⃣ Generates Encryption Keys &amp; CSR: Once you have received MZP login, the next step is to produce SSL keys and CSR. These keys will allow encrypted communication between you and Stellantis servers:  Public key will be used by Stellantis to encrypt messages.  Private key will be used by you to decrypt Stellantis’s messages. Be careful, the private key must remain secret. In order to ensure your identity, you have to produce and send a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to your Stellantis contact. Stellantis Authority will sign your CSR and send you back a proper SSL certificate. These are the required info to produce your CSR:       Information   Value         COUNTRY NAME (C)   Country code, two letters (ex: FR)       STATE OR PROVINCE (S)   ex: ‘Kansas’ or ‘Ile de France’       LOCALITY NAME (L)   ex: ‘Paris’       ORGANIZATION NAME (O)   ex: ‘Free2Move’       ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT (OU)   You must type: ‘Programs Partners’       COMMON NAME (CN)   ex: ‘MZP128745’       EMAIL ADDRESS   Email address will be used in order to download and renew your certificate   Producing encryption keys and CSR have to be done with a dedicated software. The following paragraphs are examples of CSR generation using OpenSSL and Keytool: CSR with OpenSSL: OpenSSL is an open-source software library for encryption purpose. It is widely used in internet security. You can download and install Open SSL using this link (Windows). With OpenSLL producing keys and creating CSR can be performed in one step. Create a directory with text configuration file named like ‘CSRConfig. conf’ and copy/past this text into and fill-out the form. 123456789101112[ req ]default_bits = 2048distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name[ req_distinguished_name ]countryName = COUNTRY NAME (C) two letters ex: FRstateOrProvinceName = STATE OR PROVINCE (S) ex: Kansas or Ile de FrancelocalityName = LOCALITY NAME (L) ex: ParisorganizationName = ORGANIZATION NAME (O) ex: Free2MoveorganizationalUnitName = ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT (OU) Programs PartnerscommonName = COMMON NAME (CN) ex: MZP128745emailAddress = EMAIL ADDRESS will be used in order to download and renew your certificateBrowse this place with your terminal and execute this command: 12345$ openssl req \ -new \ -keyout KeyName. pem \ -out CSRName. csr \ -config CSRConfig. conf KeyName. pem will be your keyfile name CSRName. csr will be your CSR name CSRConfig. conf is the configuration file’s nameCSR with Keytool: Keytool comes with Java Devlopment Kit. Like OpenSSL, it can be used to produce keys (in a file name keystore) and CSR. Produce your keys using this command: 1234567$ keytool \ -genkey \ -alias KeyName \ -keyalg RSA \ -keysize 2048 \ -dname  CN=MZPXXXX,OU=Programs Partner,O=PartnerName,L=Paris,C=FR,email=it@partner. com  \ -keystore KeyStoreName. jks CN Common Name (ex MZP128745) OU Do not replace Programs Partners is right O Organization Name (ex Free2Move) L Locality Name (ex Paris) C Country Name two letters (ex: FR) email will be used in order to download and renew your certificate Keyname will be the name of the keys in the keystore KeyStoreName. jks will be the name of your keystoreGenerate your CSR: 12345$ keytool \ -certreq \ -alias Keyname \ -keystore KeyStoreName. jks \ -file CSRName. csr Keyname is the name of the keys in the keystore KeyStoreName. jks is the name of your keystore CSRName. csr will be the name of the CSR3️⃣ Receive your Credentials: When the description of the App is approved, Stellantis will send you the credentials for your Application. The following data are required to perform a request to the API:  👤 Application Client ID.  🗝 Application Client Secret.  📄 Application Issued Certificate.  📜 Stellantis CA Certificate. Enroll End-Users: Once your App is registered and you have received your App Identifiers, you are able to Enroll End Users in order to obtain an access token. "

Tutorial Output:  🪙 An Access Token allowing requesting data about a user enrolled in your App. This tutorial explains how to enroll an End User in order to obtain an Access Token using the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow. This token allows requesting data about the user. First, we will need to verify if the vehicle is eligible for your use case.

Indeed, as explained in Data Availability &amp; Scopes, all vehicles are not able to generate all the data listed in API Reference. When data is not generated by a vehicle, the field or object is not outputted in the API response. That’s why you need to verify that a vehicle is able to provide the data required for your application use case. It can be done using the capability API.  The capability API will return the technical capabilities of the vehicles in terms of datasets. These capability datasets are subsets of vehicles scopes. Relations between APIs endpoints, data &amp; scopes can be found in the Data Catalog (each data has a “Scopes” section) and the API Reference (APIs endpoints have an “authorization&gt;scope” dropdown). Using the response of the capability API, and knowing the required data for your use case, you can determine whether the vehicle is eligible to your service or not. If the vehicle is not eligible, you must not enroll the user under this use case, but you can find a fallback use case fitting the vehicle capabilities. For example if your use case requires the vehicle location, but the scope data:position is not returned in the capability API response for this vehicle, then you should probably not offer your service to this user.  Technical capability &amp; Vehicle eligibility: a data being available within the capability API doesn’t mean that the user is able to subscribe third party services, checkout vehicle services. Capability API Example:       Type   Name   Value   Description   Required         Path Parameter   {vin}   {vin}   Vehicle VIN to check.

No         GET |&nbsp;                                         HTTP Request                         1234567$ curl \ --GET \ --url /authorize \ --data 'client_id=&lt;client_id&gt;' \ --header 'Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==' \ --cert 'path/to/client_cert. pem[:&lt;cert_password&gt;]' \ --key 'path/to/key. pem' \           2️⃣•2️⃣ Prompt Triggering: Before the Authorization prompt is triggered, Stellantis performs the following checks on the request:  The App should be registered and the should exists.  The requested scopes should match the one declared in the App Registration. In cases these checks are performed successfully, the redirection prompt is sent to the End User device triggering an external user agent (web view) on the End User device. 2️⃣•3️⃣ User Inputs: When the external user agent authorization prompt is triggered by the End User device, you have no more access to the authorization process. In the prompted external user agent (web view), the user will follow the consent process to give access to its Stellantis Account. The journey of the End User in the prompted external user agent is detailed in the User Journey section. User Journey: if not previously performed for another Stellantis Connected service, the following steps are required on the End User side before being able to authorize access to its Stellantis Account:  Create an account in Stellantis system.  Link a vehicle to the account.  Enable connectivity for partners (accessing party).  Closing the App: If the user needs to leave your application during the previous process, the authorization request might fail. In this case, the user needs to restart the authorization process from the start. 2️⃣•4️⃣ Authorization Code: In the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow, after the Resource Owner consent to share access to its data, an automatic redirection is triggered to the Accessing Party URI. This restriction includes an Authorization Code as an URI parameter. This Authorization Code can be exchanged against an Access Token. If the account is set up properly (check out step 2. 3), and the End-User authorizes your App to access the requested scopes, the redirection URI contains the Authorization Code. The redirect URI will contain the following data as parameters:  The list of scopes authorized by the user State value generated on your side from the initial request, for your own use.  The authorization code, this code should be exchanged for an access token.  State: This state is for your own use. In order to mitigate CSRF attacks, you should make sure that the state value received in 2. 3 is a state value that you have generated in step 2. 1. This state being generated on your side, you can also use it to embed data in step 2. 1 for future use in step 2. 3. Doing so, it’s possible to track the request and to notify your user if a consent request has been initialized but not completed.

  "title": "End-User Journey",
  "body": "Tutorial Output:  👩🏽‍💻 As an Accessing Party you’ll have a better understanding of the End User journey in the Enrollment Prompt. As an Accessing Party, this page will explain the expected consent journey of an End-User of your App when the consent prompt is triggered. This page helps you to understand what is happening on the End User side when the prompt is triggered. Consent Journey: In the enrollment tutorial, the Accessing Party requests the Resource Owner consents to access its Stellantis Account data including vehicles data linked to the account. Once triggered, the prompt will perform and guide the End User in the following process:  👤 Sign In or create a Stellantis Account.  📡 Activate the required vehicle services for 3rd party App.  🚗 Perform the required certification process in the manufacturer App.  🔓 Finally, accept or deny the scope authorization request. Once the consent has been accepted, you should also be aware that:  🚪 You should provide a logout feature in your App.  ❌ The User is able to revoke access to your App at any time.  Note: during this process, the end user might need to quit your App. In this case, the flow is lost and the Authorization Process needs to be restarted from the start. Trigger Prompt: First of all, the Accessing Party should trigger the consent prompt by following the instruction of the enrollment process tutorial. The prompt is configured by the Accessing Party, it should include the list of scopes requested to the user. The following screenshot details the user journey in the prompt, first screen will always be signed in Sign In: First of all the prompt will display a Sign In page, the User should login using Stellantis credentials. These credentials are never transmitted to the Accessing Party. In case the user doesn’t have a Stellantis Account, the prompt allows creating one using the sign up button.      Sign InAccount Creation: If the User doesn’t have a Stellantis account, it can be created using the Sign Up link:  First email &amp; password should be chosen.  Then, the user should verify the account with an activation email.  Finally, when the account has been successfully activated, the prompt should be triggered again and the user will be able to sign in.      Sign Up      Activation Required Vehicle Service Activation: Vehicles don’t upload data to Stellantis servers if no services are activated for the vehicle. This behavior ensure that only the required data are uploaded and is required to comply with RGPD regulation. Vehicle data are uploaded only if the End User has activated the appropriate services for the vehicle, checkout data availability &amp; scopes for more information about data available for a vehicle. Vehicle services need to be enabled only once, it means that if the user has already activated the services on a vehicle, this step will not be asked again. The prompt will guide the user to enable the appropriate services:      Subscribtion Required      Services subscribed Certificiation Process: Certification Process is a security layer allowing Stellantis to make sure that the user is the owner of the vehicle. This certification only needs to be performed once and will not be asked again if the user has already certified the vehicle. The prompt will guide the user to download the manufacturer App to perform the Certification process. These are the certification steps:  📞 Trusted Phone verification.  🔑 Define a Safety Code.  🔗 Perform Device pairing to Vehicle.      Start Certification      Certification Steps      Pairing Process Consent Acceptance: The consent screen is displayed if the previous steps have been performed, or if they have been performed for another 3rd party already:  Sign In Service Activation Vehicle CertificationThe consent prompt contains the list of data scope the Accessing Party is requesting to the user. The user can only accept or decline the entire list of scope requested. It’s not possible to select only some scopes of the list:   Ask ConsentAccount Logout: As an Accessing Party, you should implement a logout function in your App. Theses features should revoke token, check out revoke tokens. Revoke Access: At any time, the End User can use the manufacturer application to revoke access to a third-party App. In this case, the associated access token is revoked and your App will not be able to access the user data anymore. In this case, if the Ressource Owner wants to access the Third Party App, you need to restart the enrollment process from start.   Revoke Access"

  "title": "Data Availability &amp; Scope",
  "body": "References expose the set of all possibilities of the Accessing Party for End-Users API, but all these data &amp; features are not always available. This page explains how data are made available in the API. In order for a data to be available in the API response, it should meet all the following conditions:  📋 Reference, it should be part of the API reference list.  🚗 Produced by the vehicle. Not all vehicle models are able to produce all the data.  📡 Uploaded on the server, it depends on the vehicle services activated on the vehicle by the End User.  👤 Authorized, by the End User to the requesting Application, during the enrollment process. If a data does not meet these 4 conditions, then it will not be available when requesting Stellantis API.  📋 API References list: The API reference is an exhaustive list of the capabilities of Stellantis API. This reference list is the barebone of the system, it displays the structure of all data potentially available. 🚗 Vehicle Data Production: Stellantis Accessing Party for End-Users API is intended to work with a wide variety of vehicles of different generations, shape and motorization. All these vehicles are not equipped with the same features and sensors. Real life vehicles only produce part of the data exposed in the API references. That’s why the API can only output data actually produced by the vehicle. For example, electric vehicles do not have a gearbox; therefore gear recommendation is not a data available when requesting GET /accounts/vehicles/{id}/telemetries. 📡 Vehicle Data Upload: By default vehicle’s data are not uploaded on Stellantis servers. In order to be available online, the vehicle owner needs to activate the appropriates vehicle services. Once a service is activated on the vehicle, the corresponding group of data will be uploaded on Stellantis servers. As an Accessing Party you don’t have to handle vehicle services subscription, the subscription is automatically asked to the end user during the Enrollment Process.  Vehicle Service Availability: service availability depends on the user account. Some services might not always be available for subscription. “Partner Services” (allowing third-party applications) is not available in all countries. 👤 User Authorization: As a developer, you should enroll End Users in your application in order to access their vehicle data. The End User (Ressource Owner) accepts or deny access to a list of requested scopes. Even when accepted, the End User can still revoke your access at any time.  Consent Prompt: during the enrollment process, in the consent prompt, the End User can only accept or decline the entire set of requested scopes. In the future, End Users will be able to cherry-pick scopes on the list. Scopes or Vehicle Services?: Scopes and Vehicle Services might look similar but achieve two different goals:  📡 Vehicle Services: Data Upload: vehicle service activation will enable the upload of the corresponding dataset from the vehicle to Stellantis servers.  👤 Scopes: Authorizing Data: an end-user (Ressource Owner) can authorize a third-party application (Accessing Party) to access its vehicle data. This is done during the enrollment process. Vehicle service activation &amp; user authorization of data scopes are both managed during the enrollment process, checkout user journey for more information about vehicle services activation on the vehicle side. List of Scopes: Scopes are groups of data that a Ressource Owner can decide to share or not to a Third Party Application (Accessing Party). You can find out the scope to which an individual data belongs by browsing the Data Catalog. Scopes exist under two different categories:  🚙 Data: allowing retrieving vehicle data.      data:vehicle    data:telemetry   data:telemetry:environment   data:telemetry:privacy   data:telemetry:vehicle   data:telemetry:vehicle:ignition   data:telemetry:vehicle:location   data:telemetry:vehicle:preconditioning   data:telemetry:vehicle:tyreState   data:telemetry:vehicle:energies   data:telemetry:vehicle:engines   data:telemetry:vehicle:doorsState   data:telemetry:vehicle:battery   data:telemetry:vehicle:safety   data:telemetry:vehicle:odometer   data:telemetry:vehicle:kinetic   data:telemetry:vehicle:propulsion   data:telemetry:vehicle:braking   data:telemetry:vehicle:wipingBlades   data:telemetry:vehicle:transmission   data:telemetry:vehicle:adas   data:telemetry:vehicle:lightingSystem   data:telemetry:vehicle:maintenance   data:telemetry:vehicle:drivingBehavior   data:telemetry:vehicle:alert   data:telemetry:vehicle:alarm   data:trip   data:iision    🕹 Remote: for remote command access to the vehicle.      remote   remote:locking   remote:locking:write   remote:horn   remote:horn:write   remote:lights   remote:lights:write   remote:preconditioning   remote:preconditioning:write   remote:onboardPersonalData   remote:onboardPersonalData:write   remote:charging   remote:charging:write   remote:wakeUp   remote:wakeUp:write   remote:navigation   remote:navigation:write   remote:vehicleFinder   remote:vehicleFinder:write   remote:pnc:contractInfo:write   remote:driveAlert   remote:driveAlert:write   App registration: The first step to use this API is to register your Application.

  "body": "Monitoring is an event-based feature provided with this API, it allows to set up events patterns that will be tracked on Stellantis servers. Monitors &amp; Direct Request: Direct Requesting is the classic way to use REST APIs. Requesting vehicle data is made using HTTP Request &amp; Response, check out the API references for the list of available resources. Monitoring offers another way to receive vehicle data by setting-up patterns &amp; receiving events. When the pattern is triggered on Stellantis servers, it will send a notification For example, a notification can be triggered when the oil level is low. Monitor features: Monitors offers 3 different kinds of different patterns that can be combined together:  🗺️ Zone Monitor: The monitor is triggered by a condition based on an area. Example: leaving or entering a location.  ⏱️ Time Monitor: The monitor is triggered by scheduled time condition. Example: when the vehicle is used during the night.  🚗 Data Monitor: The monitor is triggered based on a rule made of vehicle data. Example: opening of the doors, using the AC, oil temperature increasing too much, etc.  ⚙️ Setting Monitor: The monitor is used for triggering the vehicle settings change event. How Does it Work? First of all the monitors need to be set up using the appropriate API endpoints. Then, when Stellantis servers are receiving data from your car, the event engine will check if the conditions of your monitor are satisfied. If it is the case, it will trigger the notification. Monitors offers a feature to process large amount of vehicle data. Although able to receive and process these events. Set Up Monitors: Check out this tutorial in order to configure monitors. "

specification of this endpoint.  label is the name of the monitor.  subscribeParam is the Monitor channel subscription extension:     refreshEvent: Define the period (in sec. ) between two refresh events. The refresh events are sent when the condition of the monitor is satisfied(Trigger -&gt; toggled true) after a period &gt;= refresh time because the monitor triggering is conditioned by the vehicle activity and so its data availability . A kind of periodic reminder.    channelAttributes: Additional attributes that will add to or replace the specific channel (pushnotif, webhook or websocket) ones when sending the event.     extendedEventParam: Allow to set extra vehicle data (defined in data model) to add to the monitor event when publishing.  triggerParam: Monitor trigger-param that allows to compound triggers by applying a boolean expression to evaluate them:     triggers is where to declare the triggering event blocs.    boolExp allows to setup the triggering policy.     Note: Each monitor can target only fleet only. However, it’s possible to create multiple monitors for multiple fleets. Post Monitor Response: If the monitor request is properly set-up, the monitor will be created and an HTTP response will be returned: 1234567891011121314151617{   createdAt :  2025-07-09T04:54:40. 045Z ,   _links : {     monitor : {       href :  string ,       templated : true,       type :  string ,       deprecation :  string ,       name :  string ,       title :  string ,       profile :  string ,       hreflang :  string     }  },   monitorId :  string ,   status :  Running }This message indicates that the monitor has been successfully created with a unique identifier. This identifier is sent with every notification, therefore, it allows tracking this monitor. Triggering Events Blocs: As seen in the about page, monitors are triggered under the following patterns. Checkout the API Reference for the specification of trigger events.  🗺️ Zone: Zone Alert parameter object.  ⏱️ Time: Temporal monitor for triggering vehicle moving event within a time interval.  🚗 Data: A monitor for triggering the vehicle data change event.  ⚙️ Setting: A monitor for triggering the vehicle settings change event. The array triggerParam. trigger of the monitor creation request allows declaring and name the list of triggering event blocs. Declaration of event blocs is not enough to describe the way the callback is being triggered, they must be used in the triggerParam. boolExp field in order to set up the triggering policy of this monitor. Triggering Policy: Once the triggers blocs are declared, they need to be combined together to create a triggering policy. To do so, we use a boolean expression syntax:  Grammar: Here is the list of available operands for monitors configuration.    AND: trigger1 &amp; trigger2 if both conditions have to be triggered  OR: trigger1 | trigger2 if at least one condition has to be triggered  PARENTHESIS: trigger1 | (trigger2 &amp; trigger3) to prioritize an expression over another  NOT: !trigger1 if the condition has to not be triggered This is an example of boolean expression, where z1, z2, t1, t2, o1, o2, o3 are trigger bloc names: 1234567891011{  label :  &lt;monitor-name&gt; ,  subscribeParam : { },  triggerParam : {   triggers : [   { name :  z1  }, { name :  z2  }, { name :  t1  }, { name :  t2  },   { name :  o1  }, { name :  o2  }, { name :  o3  }  ],   boolExp :  ((z1 &amp; t1) | (z2 &amp; !t1) | (o1 &amp; z1) | (o2 &amp; (z1 | t2)) | (o3 &amp; (z1 | z2)))  }}In this boolean expression, the monitor will notify the server in all these situations:  (z1 &amp; t1) = z1 AND t1 are being triggered (z2 &amp; !t1) = z2 is triggered AND t1 is NOT triggered (o1 &amp; z1) = o1 is triggered AND z1 is triggered (o2 &amp; (z1 | t2)) = o2 is triggered AND either z1 OR t2 is triggered (o3 &amp; (z1 | z2)) = o3 is triggered AND either z1 OR z2 is triggeredExamples: Time Trigger: The monitor Time Trigger Entry that specifies the start (relative or absolute) and duration of the time interval.

  "body": "In order to receive notifications sent by Monitors, a server is required for reception and processing. This tutorial details the configuration of this server. Response to Notification: When the server receives a notification from a monitor, it should always return an HTTP response, if it’s not the case, the Monitor will enter retry policy. It is important that the reception server follows the following rules regarding HTTP status:  HTTP 200 OK: when the notification has been received (no matter if the system failed during the processing of this notification).  HTTP 500 Internal Server Error: the notification hasn’t been received. 200 OK should always be the response of the server if it received the notification. It should not be taken into account if the server success or not in the processing of this notification. In any case it is always possible to retrieve the state of a vehicle using the REST API. These HTTP status are the only one supported by Stellantis notification system. Please do not use any other HTTP status. Otherwise, it could lead to a failure regarding following notification (or retry policy). Server Specification: The reception server needs to be configured to read &amp; process the notifications. Below is the server template specification, it describes the format of the notification.  Note: HTTPS must be supported and a certificate issued by a trusted public and known CA must be provided. Indeed, the URL of the server must be the same as the one specified when the Monitor is created. "

It’s the case if the response to the HTTP notification is anything else than an HTTP 2XX. Retry policy is not made for data storage use! It is a remedial tool in case of service failure of the server where the notification should be received. Policy Description: This policy of retry has different parameters:  When a message enters failure, it will be sent again until it succeeds, or retention time exceeded.  The retry delay, periods of time between two retry attempts, is 10 seconds.  Notifications are sent in batches, when 100 notifications are ready, they will be sent in a batch, even if the retry delay of 10 seconds has not been reached. Batches send notification in a JSON array in the HTTP body, specific headers and query parameters will not be available.  After 3 days (72 hours) of retry policy, the message is deleted. Maximum Retention Time: After 3 days of retry the notification message is deleted. However, it’s still possible to retrieve vehicle data using the REST API within the normal period of 2 months. After the first notification not processed, other notification messages being triggered in this monitor will also continue to be sent for 3 days after the moment they were triggered. Enter Retry Policy: Retry policy is applied if the server is not responding HTTP code 2XX (for example, another HTTP code or a time-out) to a notification send by the monitor. The notification is stored, and it will be sent again according to the policy. Get Out of Retry Policy: To get out of retry policy the server needs to respond “2XX” to any new attempt to send the notification. If it happens, the monitor is removed from retry policy and all stored HTTP notifications are sent. Otherwise, messages are deleted but vehicle data are still available through the REST API. "

It’s possible to configure Monitors allowing to receive an event from Stellantis when a pattern is triggered. (ex: oil level is low) How does it works?: Vehicles are using various sensors which aim to improve security and driving experience in the vehicle, these data are available for the development of in-vehicle applications but this Web API provide vehicle data from outside of the vehicle.  If an application require info about a vehicle, appropriate data are collected &amp; sent to Stellantis servers via cellular network. This make sure that the data are available whether the vehicle is online or not. Data are then unified &amp; processed, these steps ensure that thedata provided within this API share the same format in spite of the different types of vehicles and generation,  Data Scope: Only required data are available within this API, check out data scope.  Data Refreshment: data are refreshed from the vehicle to Stellantis on a regular basis (every 1 min before 2019, more frequently after) and also on vehicle events (ex: turning on the vehicle). API Concepts: This page describes the concepts &amp; structure of this API. "

Links provided in response allow navigating in the API endpoints like on a website. First, collections come with a pagination system. In the request you can add these optional parameters:    indexRange: allows specifying which elements of the array need to be returned, by requesting a range of elements. Example: indexRange=0-9 will retrieve only elements 0 to 9 of this collection.     pageSize: is the maximum of results you want to receive per page. Example: pageSize=15 will retrieve only 15 results per page. Use the _links objects to navigate between pages.  As seen in the previous example, there is an _links object in the response body. These links allow navigating in the pages of this collection.       Property   Type   Description         _links. self. href   string   URL of the current page in the array.        _links. first. href   string   URL of the first page of the array. Optional       _links. next. href   string   URL of the next page of the array. Optional       _links. prev. href   string   URL of the previous page of the array. Optional       _links. last. href   string   URL of the last page of the array. Optional       total   integer   Total number of elements in the array.        _embedded   object   This property contains the response of this endpoint.    Discovering Resources: Resources in the API are using HAL for HATEOAS integration. It allows interaction inside the API resources. The purpose is to access and discover the API like you browse a website: navigating from one page to another. Links are named with the idea that you can understand easily what they are about. Example for 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526{  _links : { },  total : 32,  _embedded : {   Status : [   {     lastPosition : {(. . . )},     preconditionning : {(. . . )},     energy : [(. . . )],     createdAt :  Mon Jun 03 08:35:36 GMT 2019 ,     autonomy : 290,     ignition : {(. . . )},     _links : {      self : {       href :  (. . . )status?indexRange=0-&amp;pageSize=1&amp;locale=fr-FR      },      vehicles : {       href :  (. . . )/vehicles/{id}      }    }   }  ] },  currentPage : 1,  totalPage : 32}The main resource is stored in the object_embedded. Status. Then, inside this main object, there is a _links property relative to this Status object. It allows discovering resources and navigate in the API. In the example below, you can retrieve the following links:   self : pointing to itself.   vehicles : pointing to the vehicle resource is about. Expected JSON Data: Be careful, this API is very likely to have updates in the future, that’s why your application has to support evolution regarding the schema of exposed data. In order to ensure the API backward compatibility with previous versions, we pledge to keep the same unit for each field in a JSON response body. However, it’s possible that we choose to add a new field in a JSON response body. Your application should then handle dealing with unknown properties. Furthermore, regarding the nature of this API, it could append that some fields are missing in the JSON response body. In this case, your application should be able to manage with the absence of the field and not cause an error. Example: This is an example of an exposed resource data schema: 12345678data:type: objectdescription: Data modelproperties:  field1:  type: string  field2:  type: numberAnd then here is a list of JSON data that your application should be able to handle: 1. All fields: 1234{   field1 : value1 ,   field2 : 1}2. Missing fields: 123{   field1 : value1 }3. Unknown fields: 1234{   field1 : value1 ,   field3 : 2. 5}"

  "body": "Available DataStellantis API is a technical interface allowing developers to create application that includes connected vehicles data and features for Stellantis. These API are scope of possibilities, but to access the data you need authorization. Data Scope: A vehicle is able to subscribe connected vehicle services. These services are sets of data and features. Without subscribing to the relevant data scope, the API will not return the data you are looking for.  Let’s take the example of TMTS (tele maintenance tele service), this connected vehicle service includes a scope of data related to maintenance. If a vehicle only subscribe to the TMTS service, then it will not be possible to retrieve the location of the vehicle using WEB API; indeed this data is not useful therefore not part of TMTS scope.  Note: if the data you are looking for is not part of any connected vehicle service data scope, then it’s not currently available for use. Data Minimization: Connected Vehicle Services are designed to achieve a specific goal. Like TMTS for maintenance or E-Remote Control for remote charging. The scope of data of a service fit the goal that this service needs to achieve. However, it includes only the data and features required to this goal. "

  "body": "The remote feature of this API allows sending remote action to Stellantis vehicles using an internet connection. Remote Features:  ❄️ Preconditioning: Remote preconditioning the vehicle.  🔌 Charging: Start and Stop the recharge of the vehicle.  💡 Lights: Remote to swith on / off lights.  🔈 Horn: Remote vehicle horn activation. The eligibility api will provide possible state values for the vehicle.  🔒 Immobilization: Requesting the vehicle for immobilization.  🥷 Stolen: Remote operation to update stolen state and immobilization. Only one attribute can be used at a time.  🔄 State: Refresh and retrieve vehicle status info.  📍 Navigation: A remote to share GPS positions with the vehicle so it can navigate through those positions by driving from start (1st) to end (last) position.  🔒 Locking: Remote Lock &amp; Unlock allows to lock and unlock their vehicle.  🥱 WakeUp: Remote to wake up a vehicle (so it can update its data).  🚗 VehicleFinder: Remote to get vehicle’s present location.  🚨 Tan: Remote operation to update Theft Alarm Notification suppression state and confirmation state. Only one attribute can be used at a time.  👤 OnboardPersonalData: Enable user to delete personal data for the vehicle. How does it work?When a remote action is sent to a vehicle, it will trigger notifications during the process. That’s why, before sending any remote, it’s necessary to set up a remote callback channel. If you are working with monitors already, it is almost the same as posting a monitor. Callbacks allow to setup the notifications sent by the remote and the address of the targeted server and the retryPolicy and batch sending. Callbacks can be configured to be specific to certain remote types.  Then, it’s possible to send a remote action request using a vehicle ID and the channel ID. When a remote command is sent to a vehicle, the callback server will receive several notifications as the action is being processed, checkout Notification and Errors for more information about these events.  Pending: The remote action is in processing (Accepted, Waking-Up, Send etc. ). Several Pending events will be received.  Done: The remote action is complete (Success, Failure etc. ). "

  "title": "Notifications &amp; Errors",
  "body": "As seen in the about page, notification messages are sent by Stellantis servers in order to notify the progress of a remote action command. Being Notified: When a remote is sent, the callback server will receive one or several notifications in order to inform about the progress of the action. These notifications are also available through the REST API using the GET Remotes endpoint. Notifications Details: The notifications are sent in order to inform about the possibility to trigger this action, and the status of the vehicle:  Performing availability checks: first, it will be checked if this remote action is allowed in this context, and if the state of the vehicle is compatible with the request. In these cases the notification type will be type: Pending.  Success of the Action: Then, if the previous checks are passed, the remote action will be sent to the vehicle. Depending on the success of the action, the callback server will receive notifications type: Done or type: Failed. Notification Workflow: Notification Format: 1234567891011121314151617  eventStatus : {   type :  [Pending, Done] ,   status : {    RemoteDoneEventStatus :  [Success, AlreadyDone, Failed] ,    RemotePendingEventStatus :       [Accepted, WakingUpVehicle, CheckingVehicle,      SentToVehicle, VehicleBatteryChargeTooLow,TooManyWakeUpsOverMonth] ,  },   failureCause :     [ AuthorizationError, GeneralError, VehicleError, WrongCommand, VehicleConnectionTimeout,     MissingRights, NotPossibleDueToVehicleBatteryLevel, NotPossibleDueToVehiclePrivacyLevel,    TooManyWakeUpsOverMonth, TooManyRequestInShortTime, SameActionInProgress,     NotPossibleDueToVehicleStolenState, VehicleInUse, TooManyRequestSent, DoorsOpen,     VehicleErrorOrCidInside, CidInside, ExternalChargingSystemError,     VehicleChargingSystemError, VehicleIsNotLocked, StolenVehicle, PrivacyFull,     HdmiRemoteServiceDeactivated, AlertIdentificationFailedByVehicle ]  } RemoteDoneEventStatus: This field is returned if type: Done.  failureCause: This field is returned if type: Done &amp; RemoteDoneEventStatus: Failed.  RemotePendingEventStatus: This field is returned if type: Pending. This page describes only the *eventStatus object of the notification, the full-notification format is available on the server specification page.  Info: In the case of sending a remote navigation (RemoteNavigation), the following event will NOT be received:  RemotePendingEventStatus :  Accepted  &amp;  RemotePendingEventStatus :  WakingUpVehicle . Messages Description:    Vehicle Sleep: if the vehicle is stopped, it stays awake during 3 min, each time a message is sent to the vehicle, it will stay awake 3 min more. Otherwise, if a vehicle is sleeping, a command will be sent to awake it. In this case, WakingUpVehicle notification will be received on the callback server, the delay to apply the remote action could be longer.     Too Many Wake Ups: In order to preserve the vehicle battery health, it is not allowed to awake a vehicle too often. That’s why a monthly limit is set. If the limit is reached, it will not be possible to send a wake up remote to vehicles until the end of the month, and a notification TooManyWakeUpsOverMonth will be received on the callback server.     Time Out: in case the vehicle is not connected to the internet, it is not possible that it receives the remote action. In this case an error notification will be received on the callback server until the vehicle is available again.     Already Done: if the vehicle was already in the status requested by the remote, the server will receive a notification AlreadyDone.     Charge Too Low: in case of an electric vehicle, the system will preserve the vehicle battery life by not sending remote action when the charge level is too low. In this case the callback server will receive a VehicleBatteryChargeTooLow or a NotPossibleDueToVehicleBatteryLevel notification.  State Machine: "

  "title": "Retry Policy",
  "body": "Retry policy will be triggered when the server in charge of receiving the Remote notification is not acknowledging the notification correctly. It’s the case if the response to the HTTP notification is anything else than an HTTP 2XX. Retry policy is not made for data storage use! It is a remedial tool in case of service failure of the server where the notification should be received. Policy Description: This policy of retry has different parameters:  When a message enters failure, it will be sent again until it succeeds, or retention time exceeded.  The retry delay, periods of time between two retry attempts, is 10 seconds.  Notifications are sent in batches, when 100 notifications are ready, they will be sent in a batch, even if the retry delay of 10 seconds has not been reached. Batches send notification in a JSON array in the HTTP body, specific headers and query parameters will not be available.  After 3 days (72 hours) of retry policy, the message is deleted. Maximum Retention Time: After 3 days of retry the notification message is deleted. However, it’s still possible to retrieve vehicle data using the REST API within the normal period of 2 months. After the first notification not processed, other notification messages being triggered in this monitor will also continue to be sent for 3 days after the moment they were triggered.  Info: The retry policy impacts the remote, not the callback. Others remote related to a callback are not affected by the retry policy. It also means that the server needs to respond “2XX” to a message send for this specific remote in order to get out of the retry policy. Enter Retry Policy: Retry policy is applied if the server is not responding HTTP code 2XX (for example, another HTTP code or a time-out) to a notification send by the remote. The notification is stored, and it will be sent again according to the policy. Get Out of Retry Policy: To get out of retry policy the server needs to respond “2XX” to any new attempt to send the notification. If it happens, the remote is removed from retry policy and all stored HTTP notifications are sent. Otherwise, messages are deleted but vehicle data are still available through the REST API. "

Retry Policy is described in this dedicated page.  batchNotify if notifications needs to be received in batches instead of one by one.  remoteTypes allows to set up which type of remotes can work with this callback.  Be careful: it’s only possible to send one remote action at once. However, callbacks are re-usable for multiple those remote action. Example of Remote Operation: This example creates a remote operation with the following parameters:  If the callback notification is not received, the request will be sent again every 120s until it’s properly delivered.  The callback will be sent once 10 callback notifications are ready to be sent or 300s after triggering.  The callback will be sent to https://my. post. callback webhook, with the VIN of the vehicle as a query path parameter and the Basic authentication in HTTP headers.  This callback can be used in order to send remote action: ChargingSchedule. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930{   label :  charging ,   action : {     charging : {       charge : {         immediate : false,         programs : [          {             enabled : true,             start :  PT12H30M ,             end :  PT14H30M ,             chargeToFull : false,             occurrence : {               day : [                 Mon ,                 Tue ,                 Wed ,                 Thu               ]            },             minChargingLevel : 20,             maxChargingLevel : 80,             slot : 1,             actionsType : Set           }        ]      }    }  }}If the remote operation is properly created the HTTP response body will look like: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526{   _links : {     channel : {       href :  string ,       templated : true,       type :  string ,       deprecation :  string ,       name :  string ,       title :  string ,       profile :  string ,       hreflang :  string     },     remote : {       href :  string ,       templated : true,       type :  string ,       deprecation :  string ,       name :  string ,       title :  string ,       profile :  string ,       hreflang :  string     }  },   remoteActionId :  string ,   type :  Locking }This message indicates that the callback has been sucessfully created with a unique identifier. This identifier, called {chid} is required to create a remote. Post Remote Request: The following example is the structure of the HTTP request intended to send a remote command. The following path parameters are required, they need to be replaced by the appropriate value:  {id} is the id.  {vid} is the id of the vehicle to send a remote to.  {cbid} is the id of a callback, this id is received when a callback is created.

  "title": "Server Specification",
  "body": "In order to receive notifications sent by Remotess, a server is required for reception and processing. This tutorial details the configuration of this server. Response to Notification: When the server receives a notification from a remotes, it should always return an HTTP response, if it’s not the case, the Remotes will enter retry policy. It is important that the reception server follows the following rules regarding HTTP status:  HTTP 200 OK: when the notification has been received (no matter if the system failed during the processing of this notification).  HTTP 500 Internal Server Error: the notification hasn’t been received. 200 OK should always be the response of the server if it received the notification. It should not be taken into account if the server success or not in the processing of this notification. In any case it is always possible to retrieve the state of a vehicle using the REST API. These HTTP status are the only one supported by Stellantis notification system. Please do not use any other HTTP status. Otherwise, it could lead to a failure regarding following notification (or retry policy). Server Specification: The reception server needs to be configured to read &amp; process the notifications. Below is the server template specification, it describes the format of the notification.  Note: HTTPS must be supported and a certificate issued by a trusted public and known CA must be provided. Indeed, the URL of the server must be the same as the one specified when the callback is created. "

  "body": " Stellantis Connected Car API Connected Car API IntroductionThis is the description of the Stellantis Connected Car V2 API. The speccification is is based on OpenAPI Specification version 3 and can be displayed using ReDoca or Swagger. This API allows applications to fetch data from the Connected Vehicles Data Platform. It is designed to be a declarative data and function specification, so they are understood and consumed by stakeholders without knowledge of manufacturer onboard vehicle specification API Features::  VEHICLE IOT DATA TREATMENT DEVICE MANAGEMENT Subscription, Commercial Capabilites, Management:     SAMS: Subscription management, it includes frontend/backend/Catalog(Zuora). As well as API exposition for Eligibility, Catalog, Cart, Payment, Contract. In PRODUCTION   CPA: Technical enabler responsible for onboarding and processing the reconciliation between a token and an ID Digital (Customer ID in C1ST).  In DEVELOPMENT   OMS: Technical enabler responsible for managing the link between the vehicle pre-command until delivery to the client.  In DEVELOPMENT   PROMAN:  Technical enabler responsible for managing the workflow of services activation.  In DEVELOPMENT    ABCAPI Authentication: Stellantis Connected Car APIs uses the OAuth 2. 0 protocol for authentication and authorization. Any application require a valid Access Token to access to data.  Hierarchical Scopes     Since api resources are hierarchical, API uses also hierarchical scopes. Colon characters are used to navigate to subresource scopes.     Filtering Scopes         When the API caller requests a set of scopes. The owner may not grant access to all of the requested scopes, so the application will have to adapt to the restricted access or request for a larger set of scopes again.           API backend will deliver the data related to the granted scopes only.           If no scope has been granted with the caller token then an unauthorized error will be returned.       API Errors: Error codes returned by all APIs comply with the standard. Nevertheless, PSA Services (callers) need to have more detailed data structures (even when the answer is not Http-OK) to better categorize the type of error by providing application code, message and debugging code(for investigation purposes). The HTTP code of the response is managed by the protocol itself (in the header). These APIS are likely to report the following HTTP code: Tables:       Code. .    Description…   Case. .            200   The request has succeeded and the resource data has been sent.    GET APIs.            202   The request has been accepted for processing, but not yet acted upon. An id of processing is returned.    POST/PUT requests: -Create monitor -Create a callback           204   The request has been accepted and there is no additional content   DELTE APIs: -Delete monitor -Delete a callback           400   Request cannot be processed due to invalid query parameter value of body content (for POST/PUT verbs)   ALL APIs.            401   Unauthorized request due to lack of valid authentication credentials.    All APIs.            403   Unauthorized request due to insufficient credentials to grant access.    All APIs.            404   Target resource not found.    All APIs. Even POST, PUT or DELETE if the resource id is uncknown.            500   Unexpected condition that prevented from fulfilling the reques.    All APIs.        API Output: Data format All APIs return data in JSON format. The application who uses them must take into account the evolving character of them and more precisely regarding the schemas of the exposed data. Indeed:  The missing of known data fields should not cause an error.  It should (correctly) deal with JSON content with unknown properties also. Indeed, data schema extensions should be supported without errors even if they are not used. For example:Assuming a given exposed resource with this data schema: 123456789 { data:    type: object    description: Data model    properties:      field1:        type: string      field2:        type: number }The application should be able to deal with those possible valid JSON contents:  All fields:  field1 : value1 ,  field2 : 1 Missing field2:  field1 : value1  Unknown field3:  field1 : value1 ,  field3 : 2. 5 "

  "body": "This REST API implements various endpoints to retrieve data from a vehicle. It’s also possible to remote control some features of the vehicles, like opening the doors or turning AC on. Features: By requesting this api you will have access to various vehicle features:  🚗 Car Data: Get a user or car general info, like brand, model, fuel type, autonomy, open doors etc.  🛠 Maintenance: Stay tuned on car maintenance, time and mileage before maintenance.  💥 Collision: Be notified of collisions and where it happened.  🏁 Trips: Browse into cars trips, departure point, arrival.  ⚠️ Alerts: Get history of in-car alerts (oil, engine, breaks etc).  📍 Location: Access the vehicle position in real time.  📊 Telemetrics: Retrieve and track vehicles telemetrics (speed, fuel level, blinking lights etc).  🕹 Remote control: Send remote actions to your vehicle (preconditionning, honk, lights, doors…).  Direct Request vs Monitoring:    As a REST API, this product allow to request all the data above using HTTP Request.   It’s possible to configure Monitors allowing to receive an event from Stellantis when a pattern is triggered. (ex: oil level is low) {% if page. subsection == “b2c” %} End-Users API Roles: End Users APIs allows Application Developers (Accessing Party) to access vehicle data of their Users (Resource Owner) owning Stellantis vehicles (ex PSA brands: Citroën, DS, Peugeot, Opel and Vauxhall). Check-out Get Started for more information about the full process to access the End Users API.  {% endif %} How does it works?: Vehicles are using various sensors which aim to improve security and driving experience in the vehicle, these data are available for the development of in-vehicle applications but this Web API provide vehicle data from outside of the vehicle.  If an application require info about a vehicle, appropriate data are collected &amp; sent to Stellantis servers via cellular network. This make sure that the data are available whether the vehicle is online or not. Data are then unified &amp; processed, these steps ensure that thedata provided within this API share the same format in spite of the different types of vehicles and generation,  Data Scope: Only required data are available within this API, check out data scope.  Data Refreshment: data are refreshed from the vehicle to Stellantis on a regular basis (every 1 min before 2019, more frequently after) and also on vehicle events (ex: turning on the vehicle).

Links provided in response allow navigating in the API endpoints like on a website. First, collections come with a pagination system. In the request you can add these optional parameters:    indexRange: allows specifying which elements of the array need to be returned, by requesting a range of elements. Example: indexRange=0-9 will retrieve only elements 0 to 9 of this collection.     pageSize: is the maximum of results you want to receive per page. Example: pageSize=15 will retrieve only 15 results per page. Use the _links objects to navigate between pages.  As seen in the previous example, there is an _links object in the response body. These links allow navigating in the pages of this collection.       Property   Type   Description         _links. self. href   string   URL of the current page in the array.        _links. first. href   string   URL of the first page of the array. Optional       _links. next. href   string   URL of the next page of the array. Optional       _links. prev. href   string   URL of the previous page of the array. Optional       _links. last. href   string   URL of the last page of the array. Optional       total   integer   Total number of elements in the array.        _embedded   object   This property contains the response of this endpoint.    Discovering Resources: Resources in the API are using HAL for HATEOAS integration. It allows interaction inside the API resources. The purpose is to access and discover the API like you browse a website: navigating from one page to another. Links are named with the idea that you can understand easily what they are about. Example for {% if page. subsection == ‘b2b’ %}GET /fleets/{fid}/status: {% elsif page. subsection == ‘b2c’ %}GET /user/vehicles/{id}/status: {% endif %} 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829{  _links : { },  total : 32,  _embedded : {   Status : [   {     lastPosition : {(. . . )},     preconditionning : {(. . . )},     energy : [(. . . )],     createdAt :  Mon Jun 03 08:35:36 GMT 2019 ,     autonomy : 290,     ignition : {(. . . )},     _links : {{ { }}{% if page. subsection == 'b2b' %}      fleet : {       href :  (. . . )/fleets      },{% endif %}      self : {       href :  (. . . )status?indexRange=0-&amp;pageSize=1&amp;locale=fr-FR      },      vehicles : {       href :  (. . . )/vehicles/{id}      }    }   }  ] },  currentPage : 1,  totalPage : 32}The main resource is stored in the object_embedded. Status. Then, inside this main object, there is a _links property relative to this Status object. It allows discovering resources and navigate in the API. In the example below, you can retrieve the following links:{% if page. subsection == ‘b2b’ %}   fleet : a direct link to the fleet of this status. {% endif %}  self : pointing to itself.   vehicles : pointing to the vehicle resource is about. Expected JSON Data: Be careful, this API is very likely to have updates in the future, that’s why your application has to support evolution regarding the schema of exposed data. In order to ensure the API backward compatibility with previous versions, we pledge to keep the same unit for each field in a JSON response body. However, it’s possible that we choose to add a new field in a JSON response body. Your application should then handle dealing with unknown properties. Furthermore, regarding the nature of this API, it could append that some fields are missing in the JSON response body. In this case, your application should be able to manage with the absence of the field and not cause an error. {% if page. subsection == “b2c” %}  Data Availability: this article explains how data availability is managed within Accessing Party for End-Users API. {% endif %} Example: This is an example of an exposed resource data schema: 12345678data:type: objectdescription: Data modelproperties:  field1:  type: string  field2:  type: numberAnd then here is a list of JSON data that your application should be able to handle: 1. All fields: 1234{   field1 : value1 ,   field2 : 1}2. Missing fields: 123{   field1 : value1 }3. Unknown fields: 1234{   field1 : value1 ,   field3 : 2. 5}"
